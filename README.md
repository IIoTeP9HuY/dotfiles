Repository storing my dotfiles (system configurations)

I primary use OSX and Ubuntu Linux

Installation
============

If you clone repo for the first time, you should run bootstrap.sh

This will symlink all configs to your home directory and configure your git profile.

If you have old configs in your home folder, you will be given an option to backup or overwrite them.

Later you should push/pull changed to your dotfiles using usual git workflow.

```bash
    cd dotfiles
    ./bootstrap.sh
```
